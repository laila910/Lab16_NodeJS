# Contact CRUD System 
> Steps Or notes:
 1. Install and using `express()` to create server.
 2. make Routing.
 3. install nodemon to follow up any change.
 4. create views(`addContact.html` For add New Contact,`editContact.html` for edit existing contact ,`home` for show all contacts & make actions & search contact ).
 5. Install and Add `body-parser`, Body-parser is a middleware. They help to tidy up the request object before we use them. Express lets us use middleware with the use method. The urlencoded method within body-parser tells body-parser to extract data from the <form> element and add them to the body property in the request object.
 6. You should be able to see values from the <form> element inside req.body now. Try doing a console.log and see what it is!.
